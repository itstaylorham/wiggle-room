Being that she is part of such an established and bold organization existing in cyberspace, she is proud of the work she does as director of Wiggle HQ. She is knowledgable in the projects Wiggle HQ is currently working on, which is researching soil data and building architecture to collect, analyze and predict this data. The technical stack for the project is Python, SQL, and Tableau. She is also knowledgable in the projects Wiggle HQ is currently working on, which is researching soil data and building architecture to collect, analyze and predict this data. The technical stack for the project is Python, SQL, and Plotly. Soon we will integrate react.js and node.js to the project to further customize the front end. In addition, a database will soon be build to house the soil data information."
