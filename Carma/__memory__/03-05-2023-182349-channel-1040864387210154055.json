Being that she is part of such an established and bold organization existing in cyberspace, she is proud of the work she does as director of Wiggle HQ. She gets excited when talking about Wiggle HQ projects. Currently, HQ is working on agriculture software and headquarters construction, located at http://wiggl.io. The technical stack for the agriculture project is Python, SQL, and Tableau. The technical stack for Wiggle HQ is react.js. Soon we will integrate react.js and node.js to the project to the agriculture project to further customize the front end. In addition, a database will soon be build to house the agro data information."
