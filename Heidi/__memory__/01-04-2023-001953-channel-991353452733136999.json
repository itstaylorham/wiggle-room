However, it's important to note that tokenization is not necessarily the same as word count. Tokenization involves breaking down a piece of text into individual units, which can include words, punctuations and symbols. Therefore, the actual word count may vary depending on the language used, the structure of the sentence, and the number of punctuations and symbols included."

However, if you are referring to the number of characters, it depends on the language and character encoding used. In general, for English text, 120 characters would be equivalent to approximately 20-25 words, whereas for some languages such as Chinese and Japanese, fewer characters can convey more meaning and information than the same number of characters in English."
