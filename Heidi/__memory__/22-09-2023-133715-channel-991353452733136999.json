        "content": "CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a security concept that is part of the web application security model. In order to protect users from malicious behavior, web browsers employ security restrictions known as the Same-Origin Policy, which prevents a web page from making requests to a different domain than the one from which the web page came. \n\nHowever, this can restrict legitimate, non-malicious communication and data transfer between different origins, or URLs. CORS is a way for a server to control access to its resources by sharing them with trustworthy origins and denying them to others.\n\nYour error, CORS Request Blocked, is due to the Same-Origin Policy. The server at the URL https://192.168.68.112:3000/api/sensor_data is not set up to accept Cross-Origin requests from the origin of your XMLHttpRequest. \n\nYou will need to configure the server at that URL to accept Cross-Origin requests from your origin. This typically involves adding appropriate headers to the server's response. The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is commonly used to resolve this issue. \n\nFor instance, if you are the owner of the server running on 192.168.68.112:3000, you would have to add the following headers:\n\n```js\nresponse.setHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\");\nresponse.setHeader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\", \"Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept\");\n```\n\nThis Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *  allows all domains to access the server's resources. Depending on your specific requirement you can replace \"*\" with your specific domain.\n\nRemember that enabling CORS is potentially dangerous because it allows for more avenues of attack. Always ensure that your server is secure and only allows connections from trusted sources."

        "content": "Yes, there are a few tricks to bypass CORS issues in client-side JavaScript but they should be used with caution as they could override important security measures. To resolve it without involving CORS, you might consider using a proxy server which can make the request on your behalf and then serve the result back to you.\n\nHere's a simple example using express and http-proxy-middleware:\n\n```js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst { createProxyMiddleware } = require('http-proxy-middleware');\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use('/api', createProxyMiddleware({ \n    target: 'http://192.168.68.112:3000', \n    changeOrigin: true \n}));\n\napp.listen(3000, () => console.log('Proxy server running on http://localhost:3000'));\n```\n\nThis script creates an Express server on port 3000 which proxies any requests to `/api/*` to `http://192.168.68.112:3000/*`.\n\nYou can then modify your original AJAX call:\n\n```js\nxhr.open('GET', 'http://localhost:3000/api/sensor_data', true);\n```\n\nDo note queries via proxies may not be suitable for sensitive data or performance-sensitive applications. It's always better to properly configure your server for CORS if you are in control of the server.\n\nAlso note bypassing CORS is only recommended for development purpose and should not be done on a production application as it could lead to security vulnerabilities. \n\nPlease let me know if the above explanation was clear or if you need further clarification on anything."
