Import the necessary libraries:\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime\n   import os\n   import json\n   ```\n\n2. Get the current date and time, and format it as a string:\n   ```python\n   current_date = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n   current_time = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n   ```\n\n3. Declare a dictionary of key metric data:\n   ```python\n   r2_scores = {\n       \"temperature_r2\": temperature_r2_score,\n       \"moisture_r2\": moisture_r2_score,\n       \"light_r2\": light_r2_score,\n       \"conductivity_r2\": conductivity_r2_score\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. Make a copy of the dictionary for later use:\n   ```python\n   r2_scores_copy = r2_scores.copy()\n   ```\n\n5. Calculate the 'health score' using the provided formula:\n   ```python\n   r2_scores_keys = list(r2_scores.keys())\n   health_score = 0 \n   for key in r2_scores_keys:\n       r2 = max(r2_scores[key], 0)\n       health_score += r2 * 100\n   health_score /= len(r2_scores_keys)\n   ```\n\n6. Print the health score:\n   ```python\n   print(f'\\nHealth Score: {health_score:.2f}\\n')\n   ```\n\n7. Timestamp the current record and save the 'health score':\n   ```python\n   r2_scores['timestamp'] = current_time\n   r2_scores['health_score'] = health_score\n   ```\n\n8. Define daily folder:\n   ```python\n   daily_folder = os.path.join(\"files/metrics\", current_date)\n   ```\n\n9. Check if the folder exists and create one if it does not:\n   ```python\n   if not os.path.exists(daily_folder):\n       os.makedirs(daily_folder)\n   ```\n\n10. Define the file where data will be written to:\n    ```python\n    daily_json_file = os.path.join(daily_folder, f'AGT-STAT-{current_date}.json')\n    ```\n\n11. Load existing data if possible, else create an empty list to store the data:\n    ```python\n    if os.path.exists(d"
