I have a graph in plotly and a table in HTML/JS that fetches this data, but the visuals and table records are skewed since the program is now picking multiple addresses. I'll firt show you the graph.js file for the graph, then script.js for the table. My goal is to generate as many graphs as there are MAC addresses. Later I will want to implement a feature to group them together."

It'd also be useful to know what languages or libraries you're currently working with. Are you using any frameworks or particular programming languages besides JavaScript and HTML?"
