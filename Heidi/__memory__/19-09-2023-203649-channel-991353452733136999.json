HTTP/1.1 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR: This error means that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. It is a generic error message and doesn't give specifics about the problem's nature.\n\n2. SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data: This error is usually thrown when you're trying to parse a JSON object and something is wrong with the syntax, usually an unexpected character.\n\n3. HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND: This error message means that the client was able to communicate with the server, but the server could not find what was requested. In your case, sesh.json and icon.png were not found on the server.\n\nInvestigating these issues involves checking your server error logs for any exceptions or errors, ensuring your URIs are correct, and also verifying the JSON object to make sure it's properly formed."
