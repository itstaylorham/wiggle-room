The `on_ready` event is called when the bot is ready to start receiving events. You can add the following code to your script:\n\n```python\n@client.event\nasync def on_ready():\n    print(\"Heidi is online and ready.\")\n    print(\"Completed!\")\n```\n\nMake sure you place this code block after the `client = discord.Client(intents=intents)` line and before the `async def on_message(message):` line in your script. Here's the modified part of your script with the added `on_ready` event:\n\n```python\n# Set up the Discord bot client\nintents = discord.Intents.default()\nintents.members = True  # Add this line to enable member intents\nclient = discord.Client(intents=intents)\n\n@client.event\nasync def on_ready():\n    print(\"Heidi is online and ready.\")\n    print(\"Completed!\")\n\n# Create a dictionary to store message history for each channel\nchannel_message_histories = {}\n\n# Other parts of your script remain the same\n```\n\nNow, when the bot comes online, you will see both 'Heidi is online and ready.' and 'Completed!' logged in the console."
