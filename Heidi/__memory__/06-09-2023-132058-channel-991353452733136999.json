I have a graph in plotly and a table in HTML/JS that fetches this data, but the visuals and table records are skewed since the program is now picking multiple addresses. I'll firt show you the graph.js file for the graph, then script.js for the table. My goal is to generate as many graphs as there are MAC addresses. Later I will want to implement a feature to group them together."

Also, you mentioned earlier that you would show me the 'script.js' file for the table, so I would appreciate if you could provide that file as well. \n\nFrom what I see so far, you're fetching data from an API, filtering out old data from the past 24 hours, and mapping the data into more readable formats to plot. Currently, it seems to handle data from a single MAC address.\n\nTo accommodate data from multiple MAC addresses, your program will need to group or map the data by MAC address first before it goes through this process. In essence, we're looking at potentially refactoring this part of your code to create multiple datasets, one for each MAC address. It would be very helpful to see the rest of the `graph.js` and `script.js`, to understand exactly how the data is fetched and visualized, and thus give a more accurate suggestion."
