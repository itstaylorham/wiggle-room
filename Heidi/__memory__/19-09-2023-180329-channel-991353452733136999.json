When adding records to `daily_data`, also verify the record doesn't already exist. You could use the same strategy as for `data_dict`.\n\nIf, however, you want to update existing entries rather than just avoid duplicates, you would need to ensure that you're keying your dictionaries off some unique identifier (possibly the MAC address) and when adding data, check if the key exists - if it does, update the data; if not, add a new entry.\n\nIf this doesn't address your problem, I'd need some clarification.\n\nPlease provide more detail on the structure of `df`, `data_dict`, and `daily_data`, as well as what you mean by \"duplicate list of MAC IDs\" and where these duplicates are appearing (in `df`, `data_dict`, the JSON file, `daily_data`, or somewhere else?)."

        "content": "Thank you for providing the context. It really helps to understand your situation better.\n\nIf I understand correctly, you are collecting data from some devices, and each unique MAC address corresponds to a unique device. Each time you run the script, you read the existing data from a json file into `data_dict`, update `data_dict` with the newly collected data and write it back to the json file.\n\nSince you mention that you do want to add the new data to the existing entries, rather than just avoid duplicates, I assume you would like to append the new dictionary to the corresponding list in `data_dict`.\n\nBut as per your current implementation for updating `data_dict`:\n```python\nmac_addresses = df['MAC'].unique()\nfor mac in mac_addresses:\n    mac_dec = int(mac.replace(':', ''), 16)\n    if mac_dec not in data_dict:\n        data_dict[mac_dec] = []\n    data_dict[mac_dec].extend(df[df['MAC'] == mac].to_dict(orient='records'))\n```\nThe line `data_dict[mac_dec].extend(df[df['MAC'] == mac].to_dict(orient='records'))` will add the new entries to the existing entries without any checks for duplicates.\n\nIf you're getting duplicate entries, I suspect it might be due to re-reading the same MAC addresses during the scanning process. But this would mean your scanner is picking up the same device multiple times during the same run.\n\nIf you could further clarify where exactly the duplication of MAC addresses is occurring (is it in the same execution of the script or in different executions? is it in the same json file?), it would give a better hint of where to look for the potential issue. It would also be helpful to know whether the duplicate entries have the same timestamp or not. This could indicate whether the repeated entries come from the same scan or different scans."

        "content": "The issue seems to arise from the fact that you're appending to `data_dict` inside a loop iterating over unique MAC addresses. \n\nWhen you create the `mac_dec` integer from the `mac` string and check if it's present in `data_dict`, you properly initialize an empty list check. However, when you perform the `extend` operation, you use entire DataFrame `df` for each MAC address, which essentially copies your DataFrame into each MAC address entry in the dictionary, causing duplicates.\n\nIn your `extend` operation, you should add only the records related to the currently iterated MAC address. Here's the updated code:\n\n```python\nmac_addresses = df['MAC'].unique()\nfor mac in mac_addresses:\n    mac_dec = int(mac.replace(':', ''), 16)\n    if mac_dec not in data_dict:\n        data_dict[mac_dec] = []\n    data_dict[mac_dec].extend(df[df['MAC'] == mac].to_dict(orient='records'))\n```\nThis code updates each MAC address entry with only associated records. But looking at your JSON output, it seems `mac_dec` values are overwritten due to the duplicate keys in `data_dict`. \n\nIn JSON, each key must be unique. The correct behavior of JSON when encountering duplicate keys is to retain only the last one. This is consistent with your current output. \n\nYou may replace the `mac_dec` integer with `mac` string. This will ensure that when you run your program multiple times, data will be appended to each list associated with a unique MAC address, not create new entries with the same MAC address. Here's the modified part of the script:\n\n```python\nmac_addresses = df['MAC'].unique()\nfor mac in mac_addresses:\n    mac_dec = mac\n    if mac_dec not in data_dict:\n        data_dict[mac_dec] = []\n    data_dict[mac_dec].extend(df[df['MAC'] == mac].to_dict(orient='records'))\n```\nPlease let me know if it helps!"

Instead, it will append the new data records to the existing lists identified by the MAC addresses. \n\nEach unique MAC address corresponds to a unique device and has its own list of data records in the `data_dict`. When new data comes in, the code checks if the MAC address already exists in `data_dict`. If it does exist, the new data is appended to the corresponding list. If it doesn't exist, a new list is created for this new MAC address.\n\nSo the list associated with each MAC address in `data_dict` will contain all the records for that MAC address from every time you run the script, making each list a historical record of data for a particular device. \n\nHowever, please be aware that this will not automatically remove any existing duplicate records that were added by previous runs of the script before the code was modified.

Wrap your logic for filtering the data and constructing the chart data in a function, and call it for each device:\n\n```javascript\nfunction prepareAndDisplayChart(deviceData, mac) {\n    let data = deviceData\n    // ...filter, map, and construct chart data for this device as before...\n    // When creating the Chart, use the `mac` value in options or to identify the canvas - whatever is necessary.\n}\n\nfor(let mac in rawData) {\n    prepareAndDisplayChart(rawData[mac], mac);\n}\n```\n\n3. When creating the chart, make sure to create a new canvas element for each one, as each Chart.js Chart needs its own canvas. You can do this dynamically with JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction prepareAndDisplayChart(deviceData, mac) {\n    let data = deviceData\n    // ...filter, map, and construct chart data for this device as before...\n\n    // Create a new canvas element\n    let canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\n    canvas.id = `chart-${mac}`; // Give the canvas a unique ID\n\n    // Add the new canvas to the document - you will need a reference to the parent container element\n    document.getElementById('chartsContainer').appendChild(canvas);\n\n    // Use the new canvas when creating the Chart\n    let ctx = document.getElementById(canvas.id).getContext('2d');\n    let chart = new Chart(ctx, { /* chart data and options */ });\n}\n\nfor(let mac in rawData) {\n    prepareAndDisplayChart(rawData[mac], mac);\n}\n```\n\nOne more note: JSONArray is not valid JSON, so if by any chance your `response.json()` turns rawData into a separate array for every device"
