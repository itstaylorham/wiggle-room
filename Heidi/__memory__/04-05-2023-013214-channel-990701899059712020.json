        "content": "I examined the provided code and nothing seems to be wrong with how the moisture and conductivity data points are being handled. However, there could be a couple reasons why they don't show up on the graph:\n\n1. The fetched data might not contain any moisture or conductivity values, or they may contain invalid values (e.g. null, NaN). To verify this, you can log the data and check the values:\n\n   ```javascript\n   console.log('Moisture data:', moistures);\n   console.log('Conductivity data:', conductivities);\n   ```\n\n2. The normalization process might be resulting in very small or nearly zero-values for moisture and conductivity, causing them to be less visible on the graph. If the graph's Y-axis range is too large compared to the variations in the moisture and conductivity, it might appear as if they're not being plotted. You could try adjusting the Y-axis range to better visualize the data:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Create layout\n   let layout = {\n       title: 'Sensor Data',\n       showlegend: true,\n       xaxis: {\n           title: 'Timestamp',\n           tickformat: '%I %p',\n           tick0: \"2000-01-01\",\n           dtick: 8 * 60 * 60 * 1000,\n       },\n       yaxis: {\n           title: 'Value',\n           range: [0, 1], // Set the Y-axis range, assuming normalized data is between 0 and 1\n       },\n   };\n   ```\n\nIf these suggestions don't help, please provide more information about the obtained data or any errors you encounter, and I'll be happy to assist you further."

    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Yes, if the moisture and conductivity data have a greater range of values, then it would make it easier to see them in the graph along with temperature values. However, I want to make sure I understand the question correctly\u2014did you mean to say \"greater change in moisture would make it likely that we'd see the moisture and conductivity values?\"\n\nIf yes, then a greater variation in moisture and conductivity values would make it more likely to see them in the graph. Since all the data are normalized to a [0, 1] range, if the variations are initially small, the change may appear tiny in the graph relative to other datasets.\n\nIf the issue is that some datasets are more \"visible\" or \"noticeable\" than others, one possible solution is to create separate graphs for each dataset or adjust each dataset's Y-axis scale/range individually. This way, you can better visualize the data variations, even if they have different magnitudes."
