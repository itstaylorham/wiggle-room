        "content": "Based on your `read.py` code, it seems to be continuously scanning for data with no checks on sample count. To run a model each time the process has collected 144 samples, you can add checks to count the number of samples collected.\n\nHere's an example of how you could modify your existing code to include such a check:\n\n1. Declare a counter variable `sample_count` and initialize it to `0`;\n\n2. Inside the loop where you are gathering and storing data to `sensor_data`, after the data is added to the `sensor_data`, increase the `sample_count` by `1`;\n\n3. Still inside the loop, check if `sample_count` has reached `144`. If it has, reset `sample_count` to `0` and call the function or method that represents your model (I will use a temporary `run_model()` function for demonstration). After running the model, you can continue with data gathering;\n\n```python\n...\n\n# Initialize sample_count\nsample_count = 0\n\n...\n\nfor device in devices:\n    ...\n    sensor_data.append(data)\n\n    # Increase the sample_count after a sample has been gathered\n    sample_count += 1\n    \n    # Check if it's time to run the model\n    if sample_count == 144:\n        # reset the sample_count\n        sample_count = 0\n        \n        # call your model function here\n        run_model()\n...\n```\n\nJust replace `run_model()` with your actual model's function or method. This way your model will run every time you collect 144 samples. Please note that you need to handle thread synchronization if your model function is not thread-safe while being called from different threads."
