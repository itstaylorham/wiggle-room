Here's a breakdown of the data:\n\n- The root node contains a key-value pair, where the key is a MAC address and the value is an array of objects. Each object corresponds to a singular data entry.\n    \n- Each object in the array contains the following attributes:\n\n    - `Timestamp`: It's a large number. In many cases, timestamps like these are tracking the number of nanoseconds since a certain epoch, often the Unix epoch (1970-01-01).\n    \n    - `MAC` address: It's a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications.\n\n    - `Temperature`: Represents a temperature reading (in an unspecified unit, but likely Celsius given the context)\n    \n    - `Moisture`: Appears to be a relative humidity percentage.\n    \n    - `Light`: Likely measures light intensity, but the unit isn't specified.\n    \n    - `Conductivity`: Refers to the material's ability to conduct electric current. The unit isn't specified, but it's often measured in Siemens (S), microsiemens (\u00b5S), or similar.\n\nThis data appears to be some form of environmental sensor readings from a device with the provided MAC address. The specific device may track environmental characteristics like temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil conductivity."

        "content": "Sure, I'm here to help!\n\nIn order to create a graph for each MAC address, you could organize your data by MAC address first. Afterwards, loop through each MAC address and generate a graph for each one.\n\nHere is a general idea of what it might look like:\n\n```javascript\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async function() {\n    try {\n        const response = await fetch('http://192.168.68.114:3000/api/graph_data');\n        if (!response.ok) {\n            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n        }\n        const rawData = await response.json();\n\n        let oneDayAgo = Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000000000;  // current time in ms minus 24 hours\n\n        // Organize data by MAC address\n        let dataByMac = {};\n        rawData.forEach(item => {\n            if (!(item.MAC in dataByMac))\n                dataByMac[item.MAC] = [];\n            dataByMac[item.MAC].push(item);\n        });\n        \n        for (let MAC in dataByMac) {\n            let data = dataByMac[MAC]\n                .filter(item => item.Timestamp[0] >= oneDayAgo)  // filter out old data\n                .map(item =>  ({\n                    Timestamp: new Date(item.Timestamp[0] / 1000000).toLocaleString(), // Convert nanoseconds to milliseconds and create a Date, then convert it to a locale string\n                    Temperature: item.Temperature[0],\n                    Light: item.Light[0],\n                    Moisture: item.Moisture[0],\n                    Conductivity: item.Conductivity[0]\n                }));\n                \n            // CONTINUE FROM BELOW\n        }\n    } catch (e) {\n        console.error(e);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nBy separating your data into different sections by their MAC addresses first, you're now able to create individual plots for each MAC address using the data found in `dataByMac[MAC]`. If you share the rest of your code, I can provide more precise guidance on how you might integrate this into your existing diagram generation process.\n"
