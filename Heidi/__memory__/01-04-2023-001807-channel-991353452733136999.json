However, it's important to note that tokenization is not necessarily the same as word count. Tokenization involves breaking down a piece of text into individual units, which can include words, punctuations and symbols. Therefore, the actual word count may vary depending on the language used, the structure of the sentence, and the number of punctuations and symbols included."
