Also, you mentioned earlier that you would show me the 'script.js' file for the table, so I would appreciate if you could provide that file as well. \n\nFrom what I see so far, you're fetching data from an API, filtering out old data from the past 24 hours, and mapping the data into more readable formats to plot. Currently, it seems to handle data from a single MAC address.\n\nTo accommodate data from multiple MAC addresses, your program will need to group or map the data by MAC address first before it goes through this process. In essence, we're looking at potentially refactoring this part of your code to create multiple datasets, one for each MAC address. It would be very helpful to see the rest of the `graph.js` and `script.js`, to understand exactly how the data is fetched and visualized, and thus give a more accurate suggestion."

        "content": "Great! Thanks for sharing the rest of the `graph.js` file. As stated before, it seems like this code is expecting a single set of data, and it's designed to visualize this data on one graph.\n\nIf we want to accommodate multiple sets of data, (i.e., data from multiple MAC addresses) what we can do is to add an extra step as follows:\n\n1. Discover the unique MAC addresses in your dataset. Create a new data dictionary where each MAC address has its own array of entries from the original dataset.\n\n2. Instead of visualizing with a single `lineGraph`, we would then dynamically create new graphs for each MAC address with its corresponding dataset. This can be done in a loop where each iteration creates a new graph for a single MAC address.\n\nIt would be something like this:\n\n```javascript\n// Assuming that we have a function getMacAddresses that returns an array of unique MAC addresses in the data and a function getDataForMac that returns the data for a specific MAC address\n\nconst macAddresses = getMacAddresses(rawData);\nconst dataForMacs = macAddresses.map(mac => {\n    return {\n        mac: mac,\n        data: getDataForMac(rawData, mac)\n    }\n});\n\n// Then for each dataForMac, you map the data as you do in your current file and create a graph. To create new graphs dynamically, you need dynamic element ids. These could be derived from the MAC addresses, for example.\ndataForMacs.forEach((dataForMac, index) => {\n    // data mapping as in your file\n\n    const elementId = `main-dash-${index}`; // dynamic element id\n\n    const ctx = document.getElementById(elementId);\n    let lineGraph = createLineGraph(data, elementId);\n});\n```\n\nPlease note this is a general idea to visualize each set of data on separate charts. You may need to adjust based on your exact project requirements and structure. Also, the actual implementation of `getMacAddresses` and `getDataForMac` functions depends on how your data is structured.\n\nFinally, as you mentioned the `script.js` file for table handling, could you please share it for a more comprehensive solution? Knowing how you handle the table data could give more insights into how we can integrate the graph data as well."
