        "content": "Great! Thanks for sharing the rest of the `graph.js` file. As stated before, it seems like this code is expecting a single set of data, and it's designed to visualize this data on one graph.\n\nIf we want to accommodate multiple sets of data, (i.e., data from multiple MAC addresses) what we can do is to add an extra step as follows:\n\n1. Discover the unique MAC addresses in your dataset. Create a new data dictionary where each MAC address has its own array of entries from the original dataset.\n\n2. Instead of visualizing with a single `lineGraph`, we would then dynamically create new graphs for each MAC address with its corresponding dataset. This can be done in a loop where each iteration creates a new graph for a single MAC address.\n\nIt would be something like this:\n\n```javascript\n// Assuming that we have a function getMacAddresses that returns an array of unique MAC addresses in the data and a function getDataForMac that returns the data for a specific MAC address\n\nconst macAddresses = getMacAddresses(rawData);\nconst dataForMacs = macAddresses.map(mac => {\n    return {\n        mac: mac,\n        data: getDataForMac(rawData, mac)\n    }\n});\n\n// Then for each dataForMac, you map the data as you do in your current file and create a graph. To create new graphs dynamically, you need dynamic element ids. These could be derived from the MAC addresses, for example.\ndataForMacs.forEach((dataForMac, index) => {\n    // data mapping as in your file\n\n    const elementId = `main-dash-${index}`; // dynamic element id\n\n    const ctx = document.getElementById(elementId);\n    let lineGraph = createLineGraph(data, elementId);\n});\n```\n\nPlease note this is a general idea to visualize each set of data on separate charts. You may need to adjust based on your exact project requirements and structure. Also, the actual implementation of `getMacAddresses` and `getDataForMac` functions depends on how your data is structured.\n\nFinally, as you mentioned the `script.js` file for table handling, could you please share it for a more comprehensive solution? Knowing how you handle the table data could give more insights into how we can integrate the graph data as well."

If that's no longer the case, you need to pass the MAC address as a separate argument to these functions.\n\nMake sure to update your HTML file as well to include as many `table` elements as you have MAC addresses, with the id `data-table-<index>`, as the code expects it.\n\nLet me know if you have more questions or if something isn't clear!"

        "content": "To implement a solution for multiple graphs based on MAC addresses, you would first need to identify all unique MAC addresses in your data. Then, you would filter your data by MAC address and create a new graph for each set.\n\nHere is a rough outline of one way you could handle this:\n\n1. Modify your API or data-fetching process to include the MAC address in the returned data, if it isn't already included.\n\n2. Extract all unique MAC addresses in your data. This could be done using a Set or similar data structure. In JavaScript, you can do it in this way:\n\n    ```javascript\n    let macAddresses = new Set(rawData.map(item => item.MAC));\n    ```\n\n3. Depending on how your API is structured, you might need to make a request for each MAC address individually. If that's the case, you could use Promise.all to wait for all requests to finish.\n\n    ```javascript\n    let macDataPromises = Array.from(macAddresses).map(mac => fetch(`http://your-api.com/data?mac=${mac}`));\n    let macDataArray = await Promise.all(macDataPromises);\n    ```\n\n4. Loop over your macDataArray and create a new graph for each data set. When calling your createLineGraph function, you could use the index or MAC address (if it doesn't contain characters forbidden in HTML id attributes) to generate a unique id for each graph's HTML element.\n\n    ```javascript\n    macDataArray.forEach((data, index) => {\n        const elementId = `main-dash-${index}`; // dynamic element id\n        let lineGraph = createLineGraph(data, elementId);\n    });\n    ```\n\nRemember that you'll need to create an HTML element for each graph. One approach could be to create a placeholder div and dynamically insert canvases for each graph, as in:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"graph-container\"></div>\n````\n\nAnd in the JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nlet containerDiv = document.querySelector('#graph-container');\nmacDataArray.forEach((data, index) => {\n    let canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\n    canvas.id = `main-dash-${index}`;\n    containerDiv.appendChild(canvas);\n    let lineGraph = createLineGraph(data, canvas.id);\n});\n```\n\nThis is a high-level overview, of course \u2013 you'll likely need to make some modifications to fit the specifics of your environment and data.
