        "content": "In the second part of the code, the main tasks performed are related to data preprocessing, building the neural network model, training, and evaluation. Here's the breakdown of the code:\n\n1. Data Preprocessing: The code extracts features and targets from the previously loaded `ideal_data`. Features include light, moisture, conductivity, and temperature, while targets include temperature, moisture, light, and conductivity (in a different order). Then, it scales the features using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn.\n\n2. Data Splitting: The data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`, with a test size of 20%.\n\n3. Model Setup: The SoilHealthPredictor model is initialized, and the loss function and optimizer are defined. As it is a regression problem, mean squared error loss is used, and the Adam optimizer is chosen.\n\n4. Training Loop: The model is trained for 100 epochs, using a batch size of 32. The training loop involves forward pass, computing the loss, backward pass, and optimizing the model parameters with the optimizer.\n\n5. Evaluation: The training loop also calculates the training and test losses. After training, the model's performance is evaluated by calculating the R2 scores for temperature, moisture, light, and conductivity predictions.\n\nWhile the term \"health score\" isn't used explicitly in the code, the evaluation metrics using R2 scores can be considered as a measure of how well the model is predicting the various soil health aspects (temperature, moisture, light, and conductivity). The program learns the patterns in the ideal data provided and uses the SoilHealthPredictor neural network to make predictions, with the evaluation metrics showing how well the model is performing."

Save Data for Visualization: The data for the test set, training set, and test predictions are saved to '.npy' files for future use or visualization.\n\n4. Health Score Calculation: The health score is calculated based on the R2 scores of the model's predictions for temperature, moisture, light, and conductivity. It is computed as the average of the scaled (between 0 and 100) R2 scores, ensuring that it is not negative.\n\n5. Save R2 scores as JSON: The R2 scores are saved to a JSON file named 'r2_scores.json'.\n\nThe health score in this code is calculated as the average of the R2 scores, providing a single value to assess the overall performance of the model in predicting soil health.
