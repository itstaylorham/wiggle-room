        "content": "There are a number of different ways you could approach this, depending on the exact requirements of your project. Here are a few possible methods:\n\n1. **Database**: In Python, you can use SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL to create a table structure where you gather your sensor data. You can have a `Session` table and a `SensorData` table where each row represents a read from one of your sensors. You would link these two tables by means of a Foreign Key from `SensorData` to `Session`. Each time you run your main.py, you can create a new session and record the sensor data in the SensorData table, referencing the current session. \n\n2. **Files**: If you just need to collect the data and don't need to make complex queries on it, you could consider saving it into a file (like CSV or JSON format). Every time you start a new session, you can create a new file and record the sensor data in there.\n\n3. **In-Memory Storage**: If this is a lightweight application, or for testing purposes, you could also use some form of in-memory data storage. For example, you could create a dictionary where the keys are session names and the values are lists of sensor data. Each time you start a session, you would create a new key.\n\nRemember, the best method would depend on your project's exact needs, such as how much data you're collecting, how long you need to store it, and how you plan to analyze it."
