        "content": "It seems like your current solution is reading the DataFrame `df` from somewhere and then extracting unique MAC addresses. For each MAC address, you are storing associated records into a dictionary `data_dict`. Then, you write this dictionary back to a JSON file `file_name`. \n\nHowever, you also extend daily_json_file with the entire `df` dictionary, which may cause the duplicate data you're seeing. \n\nHere, is what you might do to avoid duplicates:\n\n1. When adding records to `data_dict`, verify the record doesn't already exist. This can be done by turning your list of dictionaries to a set of tuples or using pandas `drop_duplicates`.\n\n2. When adding records to `daily_data`, also verify the record doesn't already exist. You could use the same strategy as for `data_dict`.\n\nIf, however, you want to update existing entries rather than just avoid duplicates, you would need to ensure that you're keying your dictionaries off some unique identifier (possibly the MAC address) and when adding data, check if the key exists - if it does, update the data; if not, add a new entry.\n\nIf this doesn't address your problem, I'd need some clarification.\n\nPlease provide more detail on the structure of `df`, `data_dict`, and `daily_data`, as well as what you mean by \"duplicate list of MAC IDs\" and where these duplicates are appearing (in `df`, `data_dict`, the JSON file, `daily_data`, or somewhere else?)."

        "content": "Thank you for providing the context. It really helps to understand your situation better.\n\nIf I understand correctly, you are collecting data from some devices, and each unique MAC address corresponds to a unique device. Each time you run the script, you read the existing data from a json file into `data_dict`, update `data_dict` with the newly collected data and write it back to the json file.\n\nSince you mention that you do want to add the new data to the existing entries, rather than just avoid duplicates, I assume you would like to append the new dictionary to the corresponding list in `data_dict`.\n\nBut as per your current implementation for updating `data_dict`:\n```python\nmac_addresses = df['MAC'].unique()\nfor mac in mac_addresses:\n    mac_dec = int(mac.replace(':', ''), 16)\n    if mac_dec not in data_dict:\n        data_dict[mac_dec] = []\n    data_dict[mac_dec].extend(df[df['MAC'] == mac].to_dict(orient='records'))\n```\nThe line `data_dict[mac_dec].extend(df[df['MAC'] == mac].to_dict(orient='records'))` will add the new entries to the existing entries without any checks for duplicates.\n\nIf you're getting duplicate entries, I suspect it might be due to re-reading the same MAC addresses during the scanning process. But this would mean your scanner is picking up the same device multiple times during the same run.\n\nIf you could further clarify where exactly the duplication of MAC addresses is occurring (is it in the same execution of the script or in different executions? is it in the same json file?), it would give a better hint of where to look for the potential issue. It would also be helpful to know whether the duplicate entries have the same timestamp or not. This could indicate whether the repeated entries come from the same scan or different scans."
