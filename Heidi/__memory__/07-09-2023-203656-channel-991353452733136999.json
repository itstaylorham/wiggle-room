        "content": "In order to access the song name and artist from the Spotify Web API, you can use the information present in the `track` object that you've defined in your JavaScript code.\n\nThe `track` object has a `track` property, the value of which is another object. This second `track` object then, in turn, has `name` and `artists` properties. The name of the song can be accessed with `track.track.name`. As for the artist, the `artists` property is actually an array containing one or more artist objects, as one song can have multiple artists. Each artist object has a `name` property. So the name(s) of the artist(s) can be accessed with `track.track.artists[0].name`, `track.track.artists[1].name`, and so on for as many artists as there are.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to include the song name and artist in your output:\n\n```javascript\n...\n// Get the random track\nlet track = tracks[randomIndex];\n\nlet trackUrl = track.track.external_urls.spotify;\nlet songName = track.track.name;\nlet artistName = track.track.artists[0].name;\n\n// Display output\nswitch(value) {\n  case '0':\n    output.innerHTML = `&#x1F343; Here's your song: ${songName} by ${artistName} \n    <a href=\"${trackUrl}\" target=\"_blank\"><button id=\"result-btn\"> Listen on Spotify </button> </a>`;\n    break;\n...\n```\n\nIn this code, `${songName}` and `${artistName}` are used to insert the name of the song and artist into the HTML. Please note that this code only retrieves the name of the first artist. If there are multiple artists, you'll need to modify the code to retrieve and display all of them."
